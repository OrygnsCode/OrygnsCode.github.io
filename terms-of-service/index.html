        1. Scope of Services<br>
        Orygn Business provides custom digital and technical services. These may include website development, content
        creation, SEO setup, consulting, scripts or tools, or other digital services as agreed with the client.<br>
        <br>
        2. Payments<br>
        Invoices must be paid according to the terms displayed. Work may pause if payment is delayed. All payments are
        final for custom services once any work has begun.<br>
        <br>
        3. No Refunds<br>
        Because work is customized and cannot be resold, all payments are non-refundable once drafts, communication, or
        preparation have begun.<br>
        <br>
        4. Client Responsibilities<br>
        Clients must provide accurate information and access needed to complete work.<br>
        <br>
        5. Delivery of Work<br>
        Final deliverables are provided digitally. Timelines vary based on scope and client response time.<br>
        <br>
        6. Limitation of Liability<br>
        We are not liable for losses caused by platform errors, misuse, edits by third parties, or events outside our
        control.<br>
        <br>
        7. Modifications<br>
        Revisions outside the agreed scope may require additional payment.<br>
        <br>
        8. Disputes<br>
        Clients agree to contact us before filing chargebacks.<br>
        <br>
        9. Acceptance<br>
